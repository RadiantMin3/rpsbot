## How to Play

Commands:

!rock - Throw rock

!paper - Throw paper

!scissors - Throw scissors

!kirby - Throw kirby

!candy - Throw candy

!points - Check points/wins

Normal RPS rules apply to rock, paper, and scissors. 

Here's the twist though: Kirby loses to rock, paper, and scissors. Candy beats rock, paper, and scissors. BUT Kirby (b)eats candy. Got it?
